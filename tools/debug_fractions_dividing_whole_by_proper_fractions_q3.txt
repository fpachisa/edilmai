It is always possible to divide."

The reciprocal of 3 is \\frac{1}{3}.\n\nSo, \\frac{3}{4} \\div 3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n\nNow, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n= \\frac{3 \\times 1}{4 \\times 3}\n= \\frac{3}{12}\n\nFinally, simplify the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n= \\frac{3 \\div 3}{12 \\div 3}\n= \\frac{1}{4}\n\nEach smaller piece of ribbon will be \\frac{1}{4} m long."
