    "complexity": "Hard",
    "problem_text": "Swift Delivery offers two types of services: a Car service and a Van service. The charge for the Van service is $0.20 more per kilometre than the Car service. Both services have an additional fixed charge for tolls, regardless of distance, which amounts to $4.50 per trip.\n\nMr. Lee booked the Car service for 12 km and then the Van service for another 8 km on the same trip. If the Car service charges $0.75 per kilometre, what was the total cost of Mr. Lee's trip?",
