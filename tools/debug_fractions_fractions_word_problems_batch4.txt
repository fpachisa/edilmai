        {
          "step": 3,
          "hint_text": "Total journey: 1.2 km is 2/5, so 1/5 is 0.6 km, and total is 5/5 = 3 km. First part: 3/5 of 3 km = 1.8 km. Time for first part: 1.8 km / 15 km/h. Time for second part: 1.2 km / 12 km/h. Add these times and subtract from 11:30 AM. (Time for 1st part = 0.12 h = 7.2 min. Time for 2nd part = 0.1 h = 6 min. Total time = 13.2 min. This is wrong. 1.8 km / 15 km/h = 0.12 h. 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 h. Total time = 0.22 hours. Convert 0.22 hours to minutes: 0.22 * 60 = 13.2 minutes. This is not a simple whole number of minutes. Let's re-evaluate.
            Perhaps the total distance calculation is easier.
            Remaining fraction = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.
            So, 2/5 of journey = 1.2 km.
            1/5 of journey = 1.2 / 2 = 0.6 km.
            Total journey = 5/5 = 5 * 0.6 km = 3 km.
            First part distance = 3/5 * 3 km = 1.8 km.
            Time for first part = Distance / Speed = 1.8 km / 15 km/h = 0.12 hours.
            Time for second part = Distance / Speed = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 hours.
            Total time taken = 0.12 hours + 0.1 hours = 0.22 hours.
            Convert 0.22 hours to minutes: 0.22 * 60 minutes/hour = 13.2 minutes.
            This is still a decimal minute value, which is unusual for P6. Let me check the typical P6 approach.
            Ah, P6 problems sometimes involve converting fractions of an hour to minutes and seconds or leaving it as fractions.
            0.12 hours = (0.12 * 60) minutes = 7.2 minutes.
            0.1 hours = (0.1 * 60) minutes = 6 minutes.
            Total time = 7.2 + 6 = 13.2 minutes.
            Subtract 13.2 minutes from 11:30 AM.
            11:30 AM - 13 minutes = 11:17 AM.
            11:17 AM - 0.2 minutes = 11:16.8 AM. This is very unlikely for P6.

            Let's adjust the numbers to make it cleaner.
            Perhaps the problem intent was for clean conversions.
            What if the remaining distance was 1 km?
            If 1 km is 2/5, total is 2.5 km.
            First part is 3/5 of 2.5 = 1.5 km.
            Time 1 = 1.5 km / 15 km/h = 0.1 h = 6 min.
            Time 2 = 1 km / 12 km/h = 1/12 h = 5 min.
            Total time = 11 min. This is too easy for Hard.

            Let's use the current numbers and consider the possibility of non-integer minutes.
            In P6, decimal minutes are common, but often they sum up to exact minutes.
            Let's re-check the problem to see if there's a misinterpretation.
            "He cycled the first 3/5 of the journey at an average speed of 15 km/h. He then cycled the remaining 1.2 km at an average speed of 12 km/h."
            Total distance = 1.2 / (2/5) = 1.2 * 5/2 = 3 km. (Correct)
            Distance of first part = 3/5 * 3 km = 1.8 km. (Correct)
            Time for first part = 1.8 km / 15 km/h = 0.12 hours.
            Time for second part = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 hours.
            Total time taken = 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22 hours.

            A common way P6 handles this is to convert all to minutes *before* summing, or convert the final decimal hours.
            0.22 hours = 0.22 * 60 minutes = 13.2 minutes.
            Subtracting 13.2 minutes from 11:30 AM.
            11 hours 30 minutes - 13.2 minutes.
            This will indeed give 11:16.8 AM.
            This is quite hard due to the decimals.
            Usually, they give speeds/distances that result in exact minutes.
            For example, if the first part was 1.5 km at 15 km/h (0.1h = 6 min).
            If the second part was 1.2 km at 10 km/h (0.12h = 7.2 min).
            Total time 13.2 min. Still the same issue.

            What if speeds are 18 km/h and 10 km/h?
            First part: 1.8 km / 18 km/h = 0.1h = 6 min.
            Second part: 1.2 km / 10 km/h = 0.12h = 7.2 min.
            Still 13.2 min.

            Let's re-consider. Sometimes the fraction is given such that the remaining distance is a multiple of the speed.
            If 1.2 km is the remaining 2/5 of the journey, then total journey is 3 km.
            First 3/5 is 1.8 km.
            Time 1 = 1.8 km / 15 km/h = 18/150 h = 3/25 h = (3/25)*60 min = 3*12/5 min = 36/5 min = 7.2 min.
            Time 2 = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 12/120 h = 1/10 h = (1/10)*60 min = 6 min.
            Total time = 7.2 + 6 = 13.2 minutes.

            Okay, if P6 can handle 13.2 minutes, the result will be 11:16.8 AM.
            However, a time answer must be in hours and minutes.
            Perhaps the question expects the time to be rounded? No, P6 usually avoids rounding unless specified.
            The only way for the answer to be clean is if the total minutes is an integer.

            Let's change the question slightly to make the total minutes an integer.
            What if the remaining 1.2 km was cycled at 10 km/h?
            Time 2 = 1.2 km / 10 km/h = 0.12 h = 7.2 min.
            Total time = 7.2 + 7.2 = 14.4 minutes. Still not clean.

            What if the first 3/5 was at 20 km/h?
            Time 1 = 1.8 km / 20 km/h = 0.09 h = 5.4 min.
            Total time = 5.4 + 6 = 11.4 min. Still not clean.

            Let's make the total time taken an exact number of minutes.
            If total time is, say, 24 minutes.
            Let first 3/5 be X, remaining 2/5 be Y. Total D = X+Y.
            Y = 1.2 km.
            Time_Y = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 hr = 6 minutes.
            So, Total time - 6 minutes = Time_X.
            If Total time is 24 minutes, Time_X = 18 minutes.
            18 minutes = 18/60 hours = 0.3 hours.
            Speed_X = 15 km/h.
            Distance_X = Speed_X * Time_X = 15 km/h * 0.3 h = 4.5 km.
            So 3/5 of journey is 4.5 km.
            Total journey = 4.5 / (3/5) = 4.5 * 5/3 = 1.5 * 5 = 7.5 km.
            Remaining journey (2/5) = 2/5 * 7.5 km = 3 km.
            This would mean the remaining distance is 3km, not 1.2km.

            Let's try to stick with the "Hard" level, even if the minutes are fractional, and expect students to be able to subtract it.
            Alternatively, rephrase to make it cleaner.
            "He cycled the first 3/5 of the journey at an average speed of 18 km/h. He then cycled the remaining 1.2 km at an average speed of 12 km/h."
            Total distance = 3 km. (As before)
            First part distance = 1.8 km. (As before)
            Time 1 = 1.8 km / 18 km/h = 0.1 hr = 6 minutes.
            Time 2 = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 hr = 6 minutes.
            Total time = 6 + 6 = 12 minutes.
            This is a clean number of minutes! This is more like P6.

            Revised problem text:
            "John cycled from his home to the library. He cycled the first 3/5 of the journey at an average speed of 18 km/h. He then cycled the remaining 1.2 km at an average speed of 12 km/h. If he arrived at the library at 11:30 AM, at what time did he leave his home?"

            New solution check:
            Remaining distance = 1.2 km. This is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of the total journey.
            Total journey = 1.2 km / (2/5) = 1.2 * 5/2 = 3 km.
            Distance of first part = 3/5 * 3 km = 1.8 km.
            Time for first part = Distance / Speed = 1.8 km / 18 km/h = 0.1 hours = 6 minutes.
            Time for second part = Distance / Speed = 1.2 km / 12 km/h = 0.1 hours = 6 minutes.
            Total time taken = 6 minutes + 6 minutes = 12 minutes.
            Departure time = Arrival time - Total time taken
            Departure time = 11:30 AM - 12 minutes = 11:18 AM.

            This is a much more suitable "Hard" P6 problem.

            Hints need to be updated.
            Hint 3: "Total journey = 1.2 km / (2/5) = 3 km. First part distance = 3/5 of 3 km = 1.8 km. Time for first part: 1.8 km / 18 km/h. Time for second part: 1.2 km / 12 km/h. Add these times and subtract from 11:30 AM."
            Correct answer: 11:18 AM.
            Misconception: calculation errors with large numbers of units.

            Okay, proceeding with the revised problem.
