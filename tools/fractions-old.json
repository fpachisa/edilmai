The portion of ribbon Sarah used was 3/5 of the original length.\n2.  This 3/5 portion was cut into 4 equal smaller pieces.\n3.  To find what fraction of the *original* ribbon each small piece represents, we divide the fraction used by the number of pieces:\n    Fraction per small piece = (3/5) ÷ 4 \n                             = (3/5) × (1/4)  \n                             = 3/20 of the original ribbon.\n4.  We are told that each of these smaller pieces is 1.2 meters long.\n    So, 3/20 of the original ribbon = 1.2 meters.\n5.  If 3 units (numerator) corresponds to 1.2 meters,\n    1 unit = 1.2 meters ÷ 3 = 0.4 meters.\n6.  The original ribbon is 20 units (denominator), representing the whole.\n    Original length = 20 × 0.4 meters = 8 meters.\n\n**Method 2: Find the total length of the portion used first.**\n1.  Sarah cut the 3/5 portion of the ribbon into 4 equal pieces, and each piece was 1.2 meters long.\n2.  Therefore, the total length of the 3/5 portion of the ribbon was:\n    Length of 3/5 portion = 4 pieces × 1.2 meters/piece = 4.8 meters.\n3.  Now we know that 3/5 of the original ribbon's length is 4.8 meters.\n4.  If 3/5 of the original length is 4.8 meters, we can find 1/5 of the length:\n    1/5 of original length = 4.8 meters ÷ 3 = 1.6 meters.\n5.  To find the original length (which is 5/5 or the whole), multiply by 5:\n    Original length = 5 × 1.6 meters = 8 meters.\n\nThe original length of Sarah's ribbon was **8 m**."

So, his initial money was $150 - $50 = $100.\n\n3.  **Find the total sum of money:**\n    Bala received 1/4 of the *remaining* sum. This remaining sum is what was left after Ahmad took 3/5 of the total.\n    Fraction of total sum remaining after Ahmad took his share = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.\n    Bala's initial share (1/4 of the remaining sum) = 1/4 × 2/5 = 2/20 = 1/10 of the total sum.\n    Since Bala's initial share was $100, then 1/10 of the total sum = $100.\n    Total sum of money = $100 × 10 = $1000.\n\n4.  **Find Cindy's initial share:**\n    Ahmad's initial share = 3/5 of $1000 = $600.\n    Bala's initial share = $100 (as calculated in step 2).\n    Cindy's initial share = Total sum - Ahmad's share - Bala's share\n    Cindy's initial share = $1000 - $600 - $100 = $300.\n\n    *Alternatively, calculate Cindy's fraction:* \n    Cindy's fraction = 1 (whole) - Fraction for Ahmad - Fraction for Bala\n    Cindy's fraction = 1 - 3/5 - (1/4 of 2/5)\n    Cindy's fraction = 1 - 3/5 - 1/10\n    Cindy's fraction = 10/10 - 6/10 - 1/10 = 3/10.\n    Cindy's initial share = 3/10 of $1000 = $300.\n\n**Final Answer: $300**"
