        }
      ],
      "full_solution": "1. Find the fraction of rice remaining:\n   Fraction remaining = Total rice - Fraction used\n   Fraction remaining = 1 - 2/5 = 5/5 - 2/5 = 3/5\n\n2. Calculate the total weight of the 27 small bags:\n   Total weight of packed rice = Number of bags × Weight per bag\n   Total weight of packed rice = 27 × 1/20 kg\n   Total weight of packed rice = 27/20 kg\n\n3. Use the remaining fraction and its weight to find the total weight collected:\n   We know that 3/5 of the total rice is 27/20 kg.\n   To find the total rice, we divide the weight by the fraction it represents:\n   Total weight = (27/20 kg) ÷ (3/5)\n   Total weight = 27/20 × 5/3  (Multiply by the reciprocal)\n   Total weight = (27 × 5) / (20 × 3)\n   Total weight = 135 / 60\n   Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (15):\n   Total weight = 9 / 4 kg\n   As a decimal: 9 ÷ 4 = 2.25 kg\n\nRe-evaluating the numbers in the problem statement. If each bag is 1/20 kg, 27 bags is 27/20 kg. If this is 3/5 of the total. Total = (27/20) / (3/5) = (27/20) * (5/3) = (9/4) = 2.25 kg.\n\nLet's recheck if 1/20 kg is too small to result in a 'Hard' difficulty number. For P6, 2.25 kg is a fine answer. Let's adjust the numbers to make it result in a slightly cleaner or larger number if possible, or maintain this if it's fine. 27 bags x 1/20 kg = 1.35 kg. So 3/5 of total = 1.35 kg. Total = 1.35 / (3/5) = 1.35 * (5/3) = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 kg. This is correct.\n\nLet's use 1/15 kg per bag instead to get a slightly different number, perhaps a mixed number in simplified form.\n\nProblem rephrased: A charity collected a certain amount of rice. They used 2/5 of the rice for a community soup kitchen. The remaining rice was then packed into 27 small bags. If each small bag weighed 1/15 kg, what was the total weight of rice collected by the charity?\n\n1. Fraction remaining = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n2. Total weight of packed rice = 27 × 1/15 kg = 27/15 kg = 9/5 kg.\n3. Total weight = (9/5 kg) ÷ (3/5) = (9/5) × (5/3) = 9/3 = 3 kg.\nThis gives a whole number answer, which is often preferred for P6 to avoid double fractions in the final answer if not required. This is still Hard due to multiple steps.\n\nLet's stick to the 1/20 kg value to make it 2.25 kg, as decimal answers are common, or keep it as a mixed fraction if preferred (2 1/4 kg). The prompt for answer_details says numeric or alternative formats. So 2.25 is fine.\n\nLet me make it more 'hard' by using 1/18 kg per bag and make the answer 4.5kg.\n\nNew value: If each small bag weighed 1/18 kg.\n1. Remaining rice = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n2. Total weight of packed rice = 27 × 1/18 kg = 27/18 kg = 3/2 kg.\n3. So, 3/5 of total rice = 3/2 kg.\n4. Total weight = (3/2 kg) ÷ (3/5) = (3/2) × (5/3) = 5/2 kg = 2.5 kg.\nThis is also fine. Let's make it 1/10 kg to get 4.5kg.\n\nNew value: If each small bag weighed 1/10 kg.\n1. Remaining rice = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5.\n2. Total weight of packed rice = 27 × 1/10 kg = 27/10 kg.\n3. So, 3/5 of total rice = 27/10 kg.\n4. Total weight = (27/10 kg) ÷ (3/5) = (27/10) × (5/3) = (9/2) kg = 4.5 kg.\nThis is a good 'Hard' number.\n"Total weight = 4.5 kg."

In this case, since 16 full vials were exactly filled from 1 litre (which is 16/16 of a litre, and each vial is 1/16 of a litre), there is no remainder after filling the full vials.\n\nWait, I must re-evaluate. The question should lead to a remainder. My numbers are too 'neat'. Let's change the total syrup or fraction used.\n\nLet's use the original problem statement that led to 12.5 vials for Q20. 'A large bottle holds 1 L of cough syrup. Miss Tan used 1/6 of it for her child. The remaining syrup was then poured into small vials, each designed to hold 1/15 L.'\n\nRevised problem text for Q20:\n\"A large bottle contains 1 litre of cough syrup. Miss Tan used 1/6 of the syrup for her child. The remaining syrup was then poured equally into small vials, each designed to hold 1/15 litre of syrup.\n(a) How many full vials can be filled?\n(b) What fraction of a vial is the remaining syrup that could not fill a complete vial?\"\n\nRevised solution for Q20:\n1. Calculate the amount of syrup used by Miss Tan:\n   Syrup used = 1/6 × 1 litre = 1/6 litre\n\n2. Calculate the remaining syrup:\n   Remaining syrup = Total syrup - Syrup used\n   Remaining syrup = 1 litre - 1/6 litre = 6/6 - 1/6 = 5/6 litre\n\n3. For (a), calculate how many full vials can be filled:\n   Number of vials = (Remaining syrup) ÷ (Capacity of each vial)\n   Number of vials = 5/6 litres ÷ 1/15 litres\n   Number of vials = 5/6 × 15/1 (Multiply by the reciprocal of 1/15)\n   Number of vials = (5 × 15) / 6\n   Number of vials = 75 / 6\n   Number of vials = 12 3/6 = 12 1/2\n   So, 12 full vials can be filled.\n\n4. For (b), determine the fraction of a vial for the remaining syrup:\n   From step 3, we have 12 and 1/2 vials. The fractional part is 1/2.\n   So, the remaining syrup that could not fill a complete vial is 1/2 of a vial.\n\nFinal check of answer format for Q20. It's asking for 'a) 16, b) 1/2'. My new solution gives a) 12, b) 1/2. Let's make sure the example answer is consistent with my new calculations.\n\nOk, this is a better 'Hard' problem with a remainder. The number '16' in the 'correct_answer' was from my previous idea. I need to update it to '12'.\n\nCorrected final answer for Q20: "a) 12, b) 1/2""
