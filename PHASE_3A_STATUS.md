## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. SVG Display Fix & Enhanced Problem Display Component
**Status: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

#### What was implemented:
- **Added flutter_svg dependency** (`flutter_svg: ^2.0.10`) to `pubspec.yaml`
- **Created ProblemDisplayWidget** (`/client/lib/ui/components/problem_display_widget.dart`)
  - Comprehensive problem display system supporting text, SVG, and images
  - Responsive SVG scaling with error handling
  - Both compact and detailed display modes
  - Backward compatibility with text-only problems

#### Key Components Added:
```dart
class ProblemContent {
  final String text;
  final String? svgCode;
  final String? imageUrl;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? metadata;
}

class ProblemDisplayWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  // Handles visual problem display with SVG content
}
```

#### API Schema Enhancements:
- **Enhanced SessionStartResponse and SessionStepResponse** in `api/models/schemas.py`
  - Added `assets: Optional[dict] = None` field
  - Enables SVG and image asset delivery to frontend

#### Backend Integration:
- **Updated all session route handlers** in `api/routers/v1/session.py`
  - `/session/start`, `/session/{session_id}`, `/session/start-adaptive`
  - All now include assets from item data in responses
  - Handles both `assets` and `asset` naming conventions

#### Frontend Integration:
- **Enhanced TutorScreen** (`/client/lib/screens/tutor_screen.dart`)
  - Updated constructor to accept `assets` parameter
  - Modified `_Msg` class to include `ProblemContent`
  - Updated `_ChatView` to use `ProblemDisplayWidget` for tutor messages

#### Navigation Updates:
- **Updated all navigation screens** to pass asset information:
  - `home_screen.dart` - lines 310, 413
  - `learning_path_screen.dart` - lines 413
  - `subtopic_screen.dart` - lines 310

#### Files Modified:
1. `/client/pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_svg dependency
2. `/client/lib/ui/components/problem_display_widget.dart` - NEW FILE (comprehensive SVG support)
3. `/api/models/schemas.py` - Enhanced with assets field
4. `/api/routers/v1/session.py` - Updated all endpoints to include assets
5. `/client/lib/screens/tutor_screen.dart` - Enhanced for visual content
6. `/client/lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Updated navigation calls
7. `/client/lib/screens/learning_path_screen.dart` - Updated navigation calls
8. `/client/lib/screens/subtopic_screen.dart` - Updated navigation calls

#### Impact:
- **Visual learning enabled**: Problems with diagrams (like those in `measurement.json`) now render properly
- **Enhanced learning experience**: Students can now see geometric shapes, charts, and visual aids
- **Backward compatible**: Text-only problems continue to work seamlessly
- **Responsive design**: SVG content scales appropriately across devices
