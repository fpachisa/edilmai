        "full_solution": "Let the original number of books at the beginning of January be 'x'.\n\n**Step 1: Working backwards from February donation.**\nIn February, 3/5 of the *new total* books were donated. This means 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of the books were left.\nWe are told 1200 books were left.\nSo, 2/5 of the books (after January's purchase) = 1200\n1/5 of the books (after January's purchase) = 1200 / 2 = 600\nTotal books before donation in February (the 'new total') = 5 × 600 = 3000 books.\n\n**Step 2: Working backwards from January purchase.**\nIn January, they bought new books equal to 1/4 of their *existing* collection (which was 'x').\nSo, the number of new books bought = 1/4 * x\nThe new total (before February donation) = Original collection + New books bought\nNew total = x + (1/4 * x) = (4/4 * x) + (1/4 * x) = 5/4 * x\n\nWe know this 'new total' is 3000 books.\nSo, 5/4 * x = 3000\n\nTo find x (the original number of books):\nx = 3000 / (5/4)\nx = 3000 × (4/5)\nx = (3000 / 5) × 4\nx = 600 × 4\nx = 2400\n\nTherefore, the library had 2400 books at the beginning of January."
