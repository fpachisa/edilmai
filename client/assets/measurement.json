        "full_solution": "1. First, find the base area of the cuboid:\n   Base Area = Volume / Height = 2160 cm³ / 15 cm = 144 cm².\n2. The ratio of length to breadth is 4:1. Let the length be 4u and the breadth be 1u.\n   Length × Breadth = Base Area\n   (4u) × (1u) = 144 cm²\n   4u² = 144\n   u² = 144 / 4\n   u² = 36\n   u = √36 = 6\n3. Now find the actual length and breadth:\n   Length = 4u = 4 × 6 cm = 24 cm\n   Breadth = 1u = 1 × 6 cm = 6 cm\n4. The dimensions of the cuboid are: Length = 24 cm, Breadth = 6 cm, Height = 15 cm.\n5. Calculate the area of each unique face:\n   - Area of top/bottom face (Length × Breadth) = 24 cm × 6 cm = 144 cm²\n   - Area of front/back face (Length × Height) = 24 cm × 15 cm = 360 cm²\n   - Area of side faces (Breadth × Height) = 6 cm × 15 cm = 90 cm²\n6. The largest face area is 360 cm².\n\nFinal Answer: 360 cm²"
