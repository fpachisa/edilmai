The percentage of students who prefer Comedy is twice the percentage of those who prefer Drama.\n2. 90 students prefer Sci-Fi movies.\n\nCalculate the total number of students surveyed.

            "hint": "A full circle is 360 degrees, which represents 100%. Divide the given angle by 360 and multiply by 100%."

Since (3x%) + (Sci-Fi %) = (Remaining percentage), consider what value for 'Sci-Fi %' would make (Remaining percentage - Sci-Fi %) a value easily divisible by 3 (so that 'x' is a whole number or a simple fraction). Try some 'round' percentage values for Sci-Fi (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%) that might fit into the remaining percentage.",

        "solution_guidance": "First, convert the Action sector's angle to a percentage. Then, sum the percentages for Action and Others and subtract from 100% to find the combined percentage for Comedy, Sci-Fi, and Drama. Next, use the relationship that Comedy is twice Drama. By trying out simple percentages for Sci-Fi, find the one that makes the remaining percentage (for Comedy and Drama) divisible into 3 equal parts. Once you find Sci-Fi's percentage, use the given 90 students to find the total number of students. Finally, use the total number of students and Comedy's percentage to find the number of students who prefer Comedy."
