# Current Implementation Status & Issues

## Project Overview
AI-powered math tutoring app with Flutter frontend and Python FastAPI backend. The goal is to have students click on math topics → see learning paths → start actual problem-solving sessions using real educational content.

## Current State (What Works)
✅ **UI/UX Transformation Complete**
- Beautiful dashboard with 7 vibrant subject cards (Algebra, Fractions, Percentage, Ratio, Geometry, Speed, Statistics)
- All subjects unlocked (no artificial restrictions)
- Enhanced home screen with magical gradients and animations
- Proper learning path screens with module structures
- Compact, optimized card layouts

✅ **Data Structure Complete**
- Complete `learning_paths.json` with all 7 subjects
- Each subject has 4+ learning modules with proper progression
- Learning objectives, prerequisites, and module metadata all defined
- Real problem data exists in `fractions.json` (80 problems with step-by-step Socratic method)

## Critical Issues Blocking Functionality

### 1. **Asset Registration Problem (Primary Blocker)**
**Issue**: JSON files exist in root directory but aren't accessible to Flutter
**Error**: `Flutter Web engine failed to fetch "assets/fractions.json". HTTP status 404`
**Root Cause**: Assets not registered in `pubspec.yaml`

**Files that need to be registered as assets:**
- `fractions.json` (80 problems, complete)
- `algebra.json` (needs to be created)
- `percentage.json` (needs to be created) 
- `ratio.json` (needs to be created)
- `geometry.json` (needs to be created)
- `speed.json` (needs to be created)
- `statistics.json` (needs to be created)

**Solution Needed**: Add to `client/pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - fractions.json
    - algebra.json
    - percentage.json
    - ratio.json
    - geometry.json
    - speed.json
    - statistics.json
```

### 2. **Backend API Issues (Secondary)**
**Issue**: Backend endpoints return 404 because no data is ingested
**Affected Endpoints**:
- `POST /v1/session/start-adaptive` → 404 "No more items available in progression"
- `POST /v1/session/step` → 404 "Session not found"

**Root Cause**: Backend expects different JSON format for ingestion
**Current Format** (in fractions.json):
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "hints": {"L1": "hint1", "L2": "hint2"}  // Object format
    }
  ]
}
```
**Backend Expects**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "hints": ["hint1", "hint2"],  // Array format
      "evaluation": { /* missing field */ }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Missing Subject Data Files**
**Exists**: `fractions.json` (complete, 80 problems)
**Missing**: All other subject JSON files with actual problems

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Flow
1. **Dashboard** (`enhanced_home_screen.dart`) → Subject cards
2. **Learning Path** (`learning_path_screen.dart`) → Shows modules for selected subject
3. **Real Tutor** (`_RealTutorScreen` class) → Loads actual problems via `ProblemLoader`

### Data Flow (Intended)
```
User clicks Fractions 
→ LearningPathScreen loads fractions path from learning_paths.json
→ User clicks "Start" on module
→ _RealTutorScreen loads actual problems from fractions.json
→ Step-by-step Socratic tutoring with real hints and evaluation
```

### Current Data Flow (Broken)
```
User clicks Fractions 
→ ✅ LearningPathScreen loads successfully
→ User clicks "Start" 
→ ❌ _RealTutorScreen fails to load fractions.json (404 asset error)
→ Shows error message
```

## Code Files & Status

### Working Files
- `client/lib/screens/enhanced_home_screen.dart` - ✅ Complete
- `client/lib/screens/learning_path_screen.dart` - ✅ Complete UI, ❌ Asset loading
- `client/lib/data/learning_paths.json` - ✅ Complete all 7 subjects
- `client/lib/data/learning_path_loader.dart` - ✅ Working
- `client/lib/data/problem_loader.dart` - ✅ Created but untested due to asset issue
- `client/lib/ui/design_tokens.dart` - ✅ Enhanced with magical colors

### Problem Files
- `fractions.json` - ✅ Complete (root directory, needs to be moved to assets)
- Other subject JSONs - ❌ Don't exist yet

### Backend Files  
- `api/routers/v1/session.py` - ✅ Endpoints exist but expect different data format
- Backend data ingestion - ❌ Blocked by JSON format mismatch

## Next Steps for New Developer

### Immediate Priority (Fix Asset Loading)
1. **Move JSON files to correct location**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p client/assets
   cp fractions.json client/assets/
   ```

2. **Register assets in `client/pubspec.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - assets/fractions.json
   ```

3. **Update ProblemLoader path**:
   ```dart
   // Change from:
   final jsonString = await rootBundle.loadString('fractions.json');
   // To:
   final jsonString = await rootBundle.loadString('assets/fractions.json');
   ```

4. **Test**: Click Fractions → Start → Should load real problems

### Medium Priority (Complete Subject Data)
1. Create remaining JSON files using `fractions.json` as template
2. Generate problems for: algebra, percentage, ratio, geometry, speed, statistics
3. Ensure each has proper structure with hints, steps, evaluation

### Long-term (Backend Integration)
1. Either fix JSON format to match backend expectations, OR
2. Modify backend validation to accept current format
3. Proper session management and progress tracking

## Key Learnings
- Frontend architecture is solid and beautiful
- Data structure design is educationally sound
- Main blocker is basic asset configuration, not complex logic
- Real tutoring system architecture is in place, just needs data access

## Files Modified in This Session
- `client/lib/screens/enhanced_home_screen.dart` - Complete overhaul
- `client/lib/screens/learning_path_screen.dart` - Added _RealTutorScreen
- `client/lib/data/learning_paths.json` - Complete 7-subject expansion  
- `client/lib/data/problem_loader.dart` - Created (new file)
- `client/lib/ui/design_tokens.dart` - Magical color system
- Multiple UI component files - Enhanced animations and layouts

## Final Note
The hardest parts (UI/UX design, educational content structure, tutoring logic) are complete. The blocker is a basic Flutter asset configuration issue that should take ~30 minutes to resolve.
