   - Ensure proper state management integration

2. **Connect real data** to new UI components
   - Link subject progress from Firestore to Subject Island Cards
   - Connect actual achievements from user profiles
   - Integrate real XP, streaks, and mastery data

3. **Performance testing** of new animations
   - Test on various devices (iOS/Android/Web)
   - Optimize animation performance if needed

### Priority 2: User Experience Polish
1. **Navigation flow** between new components
2. **Error state handling** in new UI
